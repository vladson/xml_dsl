# Note: The cmd option is now required due to the increasing number of ways
#       rspec may be run, below are examples of the most common uses.
#  * bundler: 'bundle exec rspec'
#  * bundler binstubs: 'bin/rspec'
#  * spring: 'bin/rsspec' (This will use spring if running and you have
#                          installed the spring binstubs per the docs)
#  * zeus: 'zeus rspec' (requires the server to be started separetly)
#  * 'just' rspec: 'rspec'
guard :rspec, cmd: 'bundle exec rspec' do
  watch(%r{^lib/(.+)\.rb$}) do |m|
    "spec/#{m[1]}_spec.rb"
  end

  # watch /spec/ files
  watch(%r{^spec/(.+)\.rb$}) do |m|
    "spec/#{m[1]}.rb"
  end
end
